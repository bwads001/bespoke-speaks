# Bespoke Speaks Status Report

## Recent Achievements

- Restructured codebase by moving files to appropriate directories:
  - Moved original `generator.py`, `models.py`, and `llmchat.py` to the `/demo` directory
  - Created improved versions in the `app/models` directory
  - Properly set up imports to use the new module structure
- Implemented a unified model loading utility with proper device parameter handling
- Successfully moved and configured the watermarking module:
  - Created `app/utils/watermarking.py` for the main app
  - Copied to the demo directory for backward compatibility
- Fixed import issues throughout the codebase to match the new structure
- Implemented most of the planned architecture according to the implementation plan:
  - Created event-driven structure with EventBus for component communication
  - Organized code into modular components (audio, nlp, conversation, utils)
  - Implemented main application class in `main.py` for orchestration
- Enabled full context preservation by using multiple audio segments for voice consistency

## Structure and Implementation Issues

~~CSM Service Wrapper and Redundant Model Loading have been addressed✓~~

## Code Cleanup Opportunities

### Fallback References
- ~~In `app/audio/speaker.py` (`speak_impl` method), comments about fallback/retry have been removed✓~~
- The speaker component still contains some references to "fallback" approaches that need to be reviewed

### Unused Context Parameters
- The Speaker class generates speech without using the ConversationContext, despite the context tracking implementation
- This creates confusion about whether voice consistency is being maintained

## Error Handling Issues

### Inconsistent Error Propagation
- Some components (Speaker) publish critical_error events while others (LLMService) only log failures
- This creates inconsistent failure modes - some errors stop the app while others allow it to continue in a potentially broken state

### Audio Exception Handling
- The StreamingRecorder's recording_loop doesn't have comprehensive exception handling
- Audio device failures might cause silent thread termination without proper notification

### Event Handler Error Isolation
- Exceptions in event handlers can impact other components
- While EventBus catches exceptions in handlers, it only logs them without proper isolation or recovery mechanisms

## Partially Implemented Features

### Voice Context Preservation
- ConversationContext tracks segments but Speaker doesn't use this for speech generation
- This prevents maintaining consistent voice characteristics across conversation turns
- The implementation in ConversationContext now supports using multiple generated segments for better voice consistency

### Interruption Processing
- Interruption detection works, but captured audio isn't transcribed, losing potential user input
- The interruption.py implementation should be simplified if only used for detection

### Resource Management
- Inconsistent cleanup of resources across components when the application exits
- Audio streams and other resources might not be properly released in abnormal termination

## Deviations from Implementation Plan

### Conversation Context
- The original plan intended full context preservation using recent generated segments
- Current implementation properly maintains this context with multiple segments
- Full implementation of `get_context_for_generation` is now enabled in production code

### StreamingRecorder Implementation
- While the StreamingRecorder was implemented, its implementation differs from the original plan
- The current implementation doesn't use the exact buffer management approach outlined in the plan

### PromptManager
- Implemented but with different parameter handling than proposed in the original plan
- Additional sample rate parameter was added for flexibility

### ConversationSaver
- Implemented but differs from the original plan in terms of method signatures and functionality
- Integration with the event bus system was added for better component interaction

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Implement voice context preservation by connecting Speaker to ConversationContext
2. Standardize error handling across components for consistent failure modes
3. Improve audio exception handling in StreamingRecorder

### Medium Priority
1. Enhance interruption processing to handle captured audio
2. Implement proper resource cleanup for abnormal termination scenarios
3. Add comprehensive isolation and recovery for event handler exceptions
4. Simplify the interruption handler if it's only used for detection
